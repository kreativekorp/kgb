The useful parts of this repository have been moved to separate repositories.

 * CharsetsKK, a collection of legacy character encodings, has moved to https://github.com/kreativekorp/charsets
 * PushChar, a Unicode character picker, has moved to https://github.com/kreativekorp/pushchar
 * Kreative Recode, a text encoding and transformation tool, has moved to https://github.com/kreativekorp/recode

What remains is not that useful and will not be maintained going forward.

 * Java Properties Viewer
 * Kreative Text Encoding Utility
 * LiveFileSize
 * PonyFix
 * Screen Ruler
